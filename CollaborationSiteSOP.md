# Standard Operating Procedures #

**When posting documents:**

> - Make sure you add a 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc where applicable.

> - Be sure to add a label if applicable. You'll see 2 already created, "Requirements" & "Minutes"

> - All requirement documents should have 3 labels... 1 for Requirements, 1 for the area (ie.. routing).. and 1 for your name. That way we can easily sort by any of those 3 categories.
