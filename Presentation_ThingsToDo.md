# Things to do for the presentation #

- Be sure to define key terms when they're first introduced... waypoint, etc.

- Every section/perspective should display prototype slides of what that area includes.

- Each section should last about 3-4 min.. which is about 20 min. Then we have 10 min for Q & A.
